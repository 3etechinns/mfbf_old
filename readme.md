#### FORECAST
Forecast estimates your future income and expenses based on your past spending, upcoming transactions, bill reminders and budgets.
Plan for large upcoming expenses such as wedding, or a vacation.

* Avoid spending over your credit card limit.
* Foresee when your account balance drops below a particular limit.
* Prevent unnecessary overdraft and minimum balance fees charged by banks.

Forecast help you foresee when your account balance drops below a particular limit. This can help you prevent overdraft and minimum balance fees charged by banks, or foresee whether you are going to overshoot the limit on your credit card. If you need to plan for a big upcoming expense (e.g., marriage, iPhone purchase), you can plan the appropriate time for making that expense based on your forecast.

The following factors are considered while projecting your account balances:
* Pending transactions
* Transactions dated in the future
* Bill reminders
* Budgets (if you have a budget of $200 per month for Food, you will see a expense forecast of $200 per month on Food.)

How does Forecast account for both budgets and reminders? Are they double counted?
```
Forecast is smart enough to reconcile the scheduled bills with your budgets, so that neither of them get double counted or left out.
For example, if you have a budget of 200/week for "Food", and a bill reminder for 50/week tagged as "Food".
Then your Forecast would include the following transactions:
* 50 / week for the bill reminder.
* 150 / week for what's leftover in the "Food" budget.
